# Spring with ORM Frameworks
Spring provides API to easily integrate Spring with **ORM** frameworks such as **Hibernate, JPA(Java Persistence API), JDO(Java Data Objects), Oracle Toplink** and **iBATIS**.

## Advantage of ORM Frameworks with Spring
- **Less coding is required:** By the help of Spring framework, you don't need to write extra codes before and after the actual database logic such as getting the connection, starting transaction, commiting transaction, closing connection etc.
- **Easy to test:** Spring's IoC approach makes it easy to test the application.
- **Better exception handling:** Spring framework provides its own API for exception handling with ORM framework.
- **Integrated transaction management:** By the help of Spring framework, we can wrap our mapping code with an explicit template wrapper class or AOP style method interceptor.

# Hibernate and Spring Integration
We can simply integrate hibernate application with spring application.

In hibernate framework, we provide all the database information **hibernate.cfg.xml** file.

But if we are going to integrate the hibernate application with spring, we don't need to create the **hibernate.cfg.xml** file. We can provide all the information in the **applicationContext.xml** file.

### Advantage of Spring framework with hibernate
The Spring framework provides **HibernateTemplate** class, so you don't need to follow so many steps like create Configuration, BuildSessionFactory, Session, beginning and committing transaction etc.
So it saves a lot of code. Understanding problem without using spring:

Let's understand it by the code of hibernate given below:
```java
//creating configuration  
Configuration cfg = new Configuration();    
cfg.configure("hibernate.cfg.xml");    
    
//creating seession factory object    
SessionFactory factory = cfg.buildSessionFactory();    
    
//creating session object    
Session session = factory.openSession();    
    
//creating transaction object    
Transaction t = session.beginTransaction();    
        
Employee e1 = new Employee(111,"Hakim",40000);    
session.persist(e1); //persisting the object    
    
t.commit(); //transaction is commited    
session.close();    
```
As you can see in the code of sole hibernate, you have to follow so many steps.

### Solution by using HibernateTemplate class of Spring Framework:

Now, you don't need to follow so many steps. You can simply write this:

```java
Employee e1 = new Employee(111,"Hakim",40000);    
hibernateTemplate.save(e1);  
```

## Methods of HibernateTemplate class

| # | Method | Description |
| - | ------ | ----------- |
| 1 | void persist(Object entity) |	persists the given object. |
| 2 | Serializable save(Object entity) | persists the given object and returns id. |
| 3 | void saveOrUpdate(Object entity) | persists or updates the given object. If id is found, it updates the record otherwise saves the record. |
| 4 | void update(Object entity) | updates the given object. |
| 5 | void delete(Object entity) | deletes the given object on the basis of id. |
| 6 | Object get(Class entityClass, Serializable id) | returns the persistent object on the basis of given id. |
| 7 | Object load(Class entityClass, Serializable id) | returns the persistent object on the basis of given id. |
| 8 | List loadAll(Class entityClass) | returns the all the persistent objects. |

# Spring Data JPA Tutorial
Spring Data JPA API provides JpaTemplate class to integrate spring application with JPA.

JPA (Java Persistent API) is the sun specification for persisting objects in the enterprise application. It is currently used as the replacement for complex entity beans.

The implementation of JPA specification are provided by many vendors such as:

- Hibernate
- Toplink
- iBatis
- OpenJPA etc.

## Advantage of Spring JpaTemplate
You don't need to write the before and after code for persisting, updating, deleting or searching object such as creating Persistence instance, creating EntityManagerFactory instance, creating EntityTransaction instance, creating EntityManager instance, commiting EntityTransaction instance and closing EntityManager.
So, it save a lot of code.
