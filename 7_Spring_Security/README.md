# Spring Security
Spring Security is a framework which provides various security features like: authentication, authorization to create secure Java Enterprise Applications.

This framework targets two major areas of application are **authentication** and **authorization**. 

- **Authentication** is the process of knowing and identifying the user that wants to access.
- **Authorization** is the process to allow authority to perform actions in the application.

We can apply authorization to authorize web request, methods and access to individual domain.

Spring Security framework supports wide range of authentication models. These models either provided by third parties or framework itself. Spring Security supports integration with all of these technologies.

- HTTP BASIC authentication headers

- OpenID authentication
- Automatic remember-me authentication
- Kerberos
- JOSSO (Java Open Source Single Sign-On)
- AppFuse
- AndroMDA

- DWR(Direct Web Request)

The beauty of this framework is its flexible authentication nature to integrate with any software solution.
